# Dependencies

Here we store external dependencies for our codebase. The purpose of this, is
to have available all the dependencies for installation in this specific
version. Also this reduces the cases in which a CI build or
installation fails, due to downtime of third party servers who initially stored
the dependencies.

Keep in mind that this code in this directory does not belong to us, it is
available free of charge from their owners and we do not hold and copyrights.
Lives in this repository only for practical reasons and using them as dependencies.
